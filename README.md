Prime Word Count
================
A simple browser application that takes any text file as input, and outputs a table containing the individual words that appear in it, how many times that word appears, and whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

How I Approached The Task
----
I started by creating the following user stories:

```
As a user,
So that I can use this app with different text files,
I want to be able to choose any text file to input to the application.

As a user,
So that I can view the file's word count information,
I want to see each word and the number of times it appears (with a note if it is prime number) outputted as a table.
```
